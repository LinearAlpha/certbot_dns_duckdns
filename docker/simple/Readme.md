# Simple

This docker-compose file will create a single container which handles certbot with the duckdns plugin. This example
should cover all the most common use cases.

## Usage

Download the `docker-compose.yml` file and adjust all placeholder values `<placeholder-name>`.

Now start the docker container with docker-compose:

```commandline
docker-compose up -d
```
